#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-beads-remote-backup.sh - verify and repair the fleet task store's off-box
# Dolt copy on mini1.
#
# WHAT IT IS
# ----------
# The routine durability check for the one private Dolt remote the captain
# approved: the `mini1` SQL remote served by mini1's dolt sql-server
# remotesapi on port 3310 over Tailscale. `--verify` is read-only and answers
# whether the backup is currently reachable and correctly wired. `--repair`
# additionally converges the wiring (re-add a missing remote entry, commit the
# working set, push this machine's commits, confirm both ends share one head).
# Every outcome is one `BEADS_BACKUP:` line, mirroring the `BEADS_SYNC:` style
# the bootstrap sweep already reports, so a sweep can call this and relay the
# lines unchanged.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT
# -------------
# This script never invents a destination: the remote name and URL below are
# the approved off-box copy, and a present entry pointing anywhere else is
# reported, never overwritten. It never runs `bd init`, never passes `--force`
# to any push, never removes a remote, and never drops a database, because any
# of those could discard history the local store is the single authority for.
# Rebuilding a corrupt remote copy from the authority (quarantine with a file
# backup, reseed, re-verify) stays a documented manual procedure exactly
# because it needs that judgment; see docs/beads-sync-topology.md.
# [`docs/beads-sync-topology.md`](../docs/beads-sync-topology.md) owns the why
# (single write authority, best-effort durability) and points here for the how.
#
# CALLERS
# -------
# `bin/fm-bootstrap.sh`'s beads sync sweep may call `--repair` for the routine
# pass. That sweep already bounds every step with fm_run_timed, so this script
# takes no step timeout of its own except the HTTP reachability probe
# (`FM_BEADS_BACKUP_PROBE_TIMEOUT`, default 10 seconds): every other step runs
# to completion and the caller owns the bound. Standalone runs inherit the
# same contract and should themselves run under `timeout` when a bound matters.
#
# EXIT STATUS
# -----------
# 0 means healthy (`--verify`) or repaired and verified (`--repair`). 1 means
# something still needs an operator, named by the last `BEADS_BACKUP:` line.
#
# ENVIRONMENT OVERRIDES (used by tests/fm-beads-remote-backup.test.sh)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# FM_BEADS_BACKUP_TASK_BIN  task CLI to drive (default: task).
# FM_BEADS_BACKUP_CURL_BIN  curl binary for the reachability probe (default: curl).
# FM_BEADS_BACKUP_REMOTE_NAME / FM_BEADS_BACKUP_REMOTE_URL: the approved copy.
# FM_BEADS_BACKUP_USER      Dolt user the mesh authenticates as (default: brainsync).
#                           The password is never a script input: it comes from
#                           the dolt server's own environment, as it does for
#                           every other mesh operation.

Usage: fm-beads-remote-backup.sh [--verify|--repair|--help]

Verify or repair the fleet task store's off-box Dolt copy on mini1.
--verify is read-only; --repair additionally re-adds a missing remote entry,
commits the working set, pushes, and confirms one shared head. Never runs
bd init, never force-pushes, never removes a remote, never drops a database.
