# shellcheck shell=bash
# fm-landed-lib.sh - single owner of the "has this work LANDED" predicate.
#
# Why this is its own library: the predicate used to live inside
# bin/fm-teardown.sh, a mutating script a side-effect-free reader (like
# bin/fm-crew-state.sh) must not source. The extraction to this pure,
# function-only library is the earliest shared boundary: sourcing it defines
# functions and performs no other work, so any reader can load it safely.
# bin/fm-teardown.sh sources it and binds its own globals through thin wrappers;
# bin/fm-crew-state.sh sources it to answer the same question its closed-bead
# gate asks (is a closed bead completion evidence, or did the work never land).
#
# "Landed" means the worktree's committed work is reachable from a remote, OR -
# for a normal ship task whose commits are not so reachable - its PR is merged and
# GitHub reports a PR head that contains the current local work, or its content is
# already present in the up-to-date default branch. This recognizes the common
# squash-merge-then-delete-branch flow, where the branch's own commits live nowhere
# on a remote yet the change is fully in main.
#
# Nothing here touches the index, the working tree, HEAD, or any local branch, so
# no reader can be left with a changed checkout. Its writes are confined to the
# object store, plus the one remote-tracking ref (and FETCH_HEAD) a fetch updates,
# and they only ever ADD objects. There are FOUR of them, not just the fetches.
# TWO ARE FETCHES, each a read of the remote teardown already performed:
# fm_landed_content_in_default fetches the default branch so the content comparison
# runs against an up-to-date one, and fm_landed_ensure_commit_object fetches
# refs/pull/<n>/head when a merged PR's head commit is not present locally, the
# ordinary squash-merge-then-delete-branch case. THE OTHER TWO ARE PURELY LOCAL:
# fm_landed_squash_merged_pr_contains_work and fm_landed_content_in_default each run
# `git merge-tree --write-tree`, which by definition stores the merged tree objects
# it computes. Each probe fails closed: any lookup, fetch, or git operation that
# cannot answer returns non-zero, which the caller treats as unlanded rather than
# guessing.
#
# Setting FM_LANDED_NET_TIMEOUT opts the caller into a STRICTER POSTURE with two
# halves that travel together, because a caller that cannot afford to wait also
# cannot afford to be asked a question: a single overall bound on the predicate's
# remote work, and a never-prompt guarantee on the two fetches (they run under
# GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 and GIT_ASKPASS=true, so a missing credential fails fast
# into the unlanded fail-safe instead of blocking on a terminal read).
#
# The DEFAULT path - no FM_LANDED_NET_TIMEOUT - is unbounded and may prompt, which
# is bin/fm-teardown.sh's historic behavior, preserved deliberately: teardown asks
# this question once, interactively, at a gate that REFUSES to remove a worktree,
# so waiting out a slow remote (or letting an operator answer a credential prompt)
# is far cheaper than refusing a teardown - or filing a staleness triage bead - for
# work that actually landed. A future caller that says nothing inherits that same
# safe semantics rather than a posture meant for the watcher.
#
# When the bound IS requested, fm_work_is_landed opens ONE deadline that every
# remote leg shares (the two fetches, `gh pr view`, `gh-axi pr list`), so the whole
# predicate's remote work costs at most FM_LANDED_NET_TIMEOUT seconds however many
# legs it runs, rather than that bound once per leg. bin/fm-crew-state.sh is the
# caller that opts in, at 10 seconds (its own FM_CREW_STATE_LANDED_TIMEOUT,
# matching FM_CREW_STATE_NM_TIMEOUT), because its closed-bead gate runs on every
# supervision poll and an unreachable remote or a blocking credential helper must
# not stall the watcher. A deadline that expires exits non-zero, which lands in the
# same fail-closed direction as any other probe that cannot answer.
#
# Functions take the worktree dir and (where needed) the project dir explicitly;
# no function depends on ambient globals, so the same code serves teardown,
# crew-state, and any future reader with a different variable naming scheme.
