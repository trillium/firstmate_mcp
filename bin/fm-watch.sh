# Firstmate watcher.
# Classifies supervision wakes in bash. In normal mode it absorbs benign wakes
# and keeps blocking; it queues and exits only for actionable wakes.
# The no-verb signal and stale path is absorb-only-when-provably-working: a wake
# is absorbed only when the crew shows POSITIVE evidence it is still working (an
# actively-running no-mistakes step, or a backend busy signal), and surfaced
# otherwise, so a crew that finishes (or stops and waits) without a current
# working signal is never silently swallowed. A declared external-wait pause is
# the separate idle absorb case and re-surfaces only on its long bounded cadence,
# although its initial no-verb status signal still surfaces in normal mode.
# While state/.afk exists, the daemon owns triage and this watcher queues and exits
# on every wake. Printed reason lines:
#   signal: <file>...      status/turn-end signals, surfaced when a listed status
#                          has a captain-relevant verb OR a no-verb signal's crew
#                          is not provably working, unless afk is active
#   stale: <window>        a provably-working stale is ALWAYS absorbed (with a wedge
#                          timer) regardless of what the status log says - an active
#                          run-step or busy pane outranks even a captain-relevant log
#                          line, since the crew's own log gets no new entry once
#                          firstmate hands it to a no-mistakes validation. A declared
#                          external-wait pause is absorbed instead with its own long
#                          re-surface cadence, never as a wedge. Only when neither
#                          absorb class applies does the log's last line decide:
#                          terminal (captain-relevant) or non-terminal (no verb),
#                          both surfaced at once. A provably-working stale past the
#                          wedge threshold also surfaces, with an "escalation N"
#                          count in the reason; at FM_WEDGE_DEMAND_INSPECT_COUNT
#                          consecutive escalations on the SAME pane, the reason
#                          also carries a "demand-deep-inspection" marker so the
#                          wake payload itself, not just repetition, forces a
#                          closer look instead of another routine supervision
#                          resume. Unless afk is active. A genuinely busy pane
#                          (window_is_busy true) is exempt from the above, but
#                          only up to BUSY_TURN_MAX_SECS with no completed turn
#                          (state/<id>.turn-ended, or the spawn record before any
#                          turn completes); past that bound busy_turn_over_age
#                          routes it through the same wedge timer, so it surfaces
#                          with the identical "stale: ..." reason, escalation
#                          count, and demand-deep-inspection marker, for human
#                          inspection only - never an automatic interrupt,

# The singleton-lock acquisition, EXIT trap, and the blocking supervision loop
# all live below the source guard at the very bottom of this file (see "Main
# entry"). Sourcing this file for unit tests therefore loads the functions -
# including the event-wait splice below - and returns before acquiring the lock
# or starting the loop. Running it as a script executes the runtime exactly as
# before, byte-for-byte.

# Portable stat, via the single owner in bin/fm-stat-lib.sh (sourced above through
# fm-pr-lib.sh, and again explicitly here because this file calls it directly).
# Two traps that lib exists to close, both of which used to live here:
#   - `stat -f <fmt> ... || stat -c <fmt> ...` is unsafe, because GNU's `-f` is
#     --file-system: it writes a filesystem dump to stdout and the `||` never
#     fires, so arithmetic under `set -u` aborts on a stray token and silently
#     kills the watcher mid-cycle.
#   - `uname` is the wrong discriminator. A Darwin kernel routinely resolves
#     `stat` to GNU coreutils (nix-darwin, or Homebrew coreutils ahead of
#     /usr/bin on PATH), so the kernel's name does not predict the binary's
#     dialect. fm-stat-lib.sh feature-detects the binary once and caches it.

# Always-on wake triage: most wakes during a long crew validation are benign (a
# working: note or turn-end while a pipeline runs, a no-change heartbeat). Rather
# than wake firstmate's LLM for each, this watcher classifies every wake in bash
# and ABSORBS the benign majority - it advances the suppression marker, logs to a
# debug log, and keeps blocking WITHOUT enqueuing or exiting. The no-verb signal
# / stale path is absorb-only-when-provably-working: such a wake is absorbed ONLY
# while the crew shows positive evidence it is still working (an actively-running
# no-mistakes step, or a busy pane, via crew_is_provably_working over
# fm-crew-state.sh); a crew that stopped its turn with no running pipeline and no
# busy pane is SURFACED, so a finish reported only through interactive pane menus
# (no done: status) is never swallowed. An ACTIONABLE wake (a captain-relevant
# signal, a no-verb signal whose crew is not provably working, any check, a stale
# pane whose crew is not provably working, a provably-working stale past the
# threshold, or anything unknown) is written to the durable queue and exits, which
# is what wakes the LLM through the background-task completion. The same classifier
# (fm-classify-lib.sh) backs the away-mode daemon; while state/.afk exists the

# staleness_focus_guard_blocks_reap: 0 (BLOCK the idle>2h auto-close reclaim this
# cycle) when a human is - or was very recently - actively viewing this task's
# pane; 1 (allow the reclaim) otherwise. The current focus state is read once per
# poll by staleness_focus_stamp and passed in here, so this is a pure decision
# with no second backend read. All three focus branches converge on ONE reap
# rule: reap iff the pane is NOT focused now AND has no fresh state/.focus-<key>
# recency marker within STALENESS_FOCUS_GRACE_SECS. "na" (a focus-unaware backend
# such as tmux) and "unsupported" (a herdr build that structurally cannot report
# pane focus) skip the guard entirely and allow the reclaim, so a focus-less
# backend can never permanently wedge the idle>2h auto-close. A currently-focused
# pane always blocks. An unreadable ("unknown") pane stays protective while its
# consecutive-unknown count is below the bound (a transient focus-read blip is
# forgiven, err toward NOT reaping); once STALENESS_AUTOCLOSE_MAX_RETRIES
# consecutive unknown polls accumulate (staleness_focus_stamp advances
# state/.focus-unknown-<key> and resets it on any readable poll) the unknown pane
# is subjected to the SAME within-grace recency check as an unfocused pane, so a
# persistently-unreadable dead/destroyed herdr runtime (no fresh marker) falls
# through to reap while a live pane focused within the grace window stays blocked
# even through a sustained unreadable stretch. Every blocked reclaim is logged - a
# silent skip reads as "nothing happened". Never a failure: a focus-blocked skip

# committed-but-unlanded or ask-user-parked work: that orphan meta just sits with
# its work preserved but nothing durable filed for triage. This sweep gives that
# dead-window case the SAME triage filing the live-idle path has. For each
# kind=ship meta whose recorded endpoint is CONFIDENTLY dead
# (fm_backend_agent_alive == dead - an ambiguous or transiently unreadable
# endpoint stays untouched, matching the secondmate liveness sweep's discipline),
# it delegates to fm-teardown.sh --staleness-file-dead. That mode reuses
# work_is_landed and the fail-open fm-staleness-file.sh, files a staleness bead
# (or the state/<id>.staleness-unfiled fallback) ONLY for unlanded work, and
# NEVER kills anything, removes the meta, or touches the worktree, branch, or any
# uncommitted change - the never-discard-unlanded-work invariant is preserved.
# Idempotent: teardown skips a task already filed, so a repeated sweep never
# re-files. Fail-open like every other sweep here: a delegation failure is logged
# and never breaks the loop. Runs during afk too - tracking a wasted orphan
# matters most while nobody is watching - since the filing is non-destructive.
