# Claude Stop-owned watcher auto-arm (asyncRewake hook).
#
# Registered in tracked .claude/settings.json as a Stop command hook with
# "asyncRewake": true and an explicit multi-hour timeout. Claude Code fires it
# in the background on EVERY Stop of a Claude primary session, with no
# deduplication across firings. It owns routine tokenless watcher continuity
# for Claude primaries (main home and marked secondmate homes):
#
#   - Scope: only a genuine primary checkout (plain checkout or validly marked
#     secondmate home) with AGENTS.md, bin/, and the effective state dir - the
#     exact fm-turnend-guard.sh scope. Child crew/scout worktrees stay inert.
#   - Identity: only when THIS session's harness ancestor holds state/.lock.
#     When an existing numeric owner fails the shared harness-liveness predicate,
#     the hook delegates guarded recovery to bin/fm-lock.sh and then re-verifies
#     ownership. A live owner, missing lock, malformed lock, or unresolved
#     ancestry remains inert, so a competing session never arms or rewakes.
#   - AFK: while state/.afk exists the away daemon owns the watcher and triage;
#     this hook exits 0 and NEVER rewakes the primary (checked again at
#     translation time so a mid-cycle AFK transition is honored).
#   - Need: arms only while work is in flight (state/*.meta) or X mode has a
#     relay poll to run (state/x-watch.check.sh); an idle home exits 0.
#   - Single-flight: Claude does not dedupe async hooks, so a home-scoped owner
#     lock (state/.claude-autoarm.lock) admits exactly one owner; every other
#     concurrent firing exits 0 without translating, which keeps one event
#     epoch on exactly one recovery turn.
#   - Foreground arm: the owner runs bin/fm-watch-arm.sh in the FOREGROUND of
#     this hook-owned process tree (never shell &); Claude owns the process
#     group, so its timeout/session teardown kills arm and watcher together.
#   - Continuity: a quiet arm close is NOT proof that supervision survived. The
#     arm's benign "idle" line asserts that "adapter re-arm owns continuity",
#     and for a Claude primary this hook IS that adapter - so exiting 0 on it
#     would hand continuity to itself and then quit, leaving zero watchers with
#     nothing scheduled to notice. This owner therefore VERIFIES continuity
#     after every quiet close (fm_watcher_healthy, the live lock + identity +
#     beacon gate) and re-arms in this same foreground tree when no live watcher
#     survived, bounded by FM_AUTOARM_MAX_REARMS. Never a detached successor:
#     that would leave a watcher alive with no owner to notify.
#   - Translation: while supervision is still needed and AFK remains inactive,
#     an actionable arm close (signal:/stale:/check:/heartbeat), a typed
#     watcher: FAILED, or an exhausted re-arm budget prints one rewake banner to
#     stderr and exits 2, which wakes Claude even while idle ("Stop hook
#     feedback"). Exit 0 is reserved for the cases where supervision is provably
#     fine: no remaining need, AFK took over, or a live watcher genuinely holds
#     the singleton.
#
# The epoch ledger state/.claude-autoarm-epoch records the latest claim and
# outcome so the synchronous Stop guard (bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh --claude) can
# allow a stop whose recovery this hook already owns, instead of forcing a
# duplicate continuation for the same event epoch.
#
# This hook never blocks the Stop decision itself and never prints to stdout:
# exit 0 is always silent, and exit 2 carries the rewake banner on stderr.
# On any uncertainty such as unresolvable ancestry, malformed lock state, or
# lock contention, it exits 0 and leaves continuity to the synchronous guard and
# the model.
