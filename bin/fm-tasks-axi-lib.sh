# shellcheck shell=bash
# Shared backlog backend selection (tasks-axi, beads, or manual) and tasks-axi
# compatibility probe for bootstrap, teardown, and secondmate backlog handoff.
# Usage: . bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh
#
# Compatible means tasks-axi --version reports FM_TASKS_AXI_MIN or newer,
# `tasks-axi update --help` exposes --archive-body for recoverable note rewrites,
# and `tasks-axi mv --help` exposes [<id>...] for atomic multi-ID moves required
# by secondmate handoffs.
# FM_TASKS_AXI_MIN follows the axi-family floor policy owned beside the floor
# constants in bin/fm-bootstrap.sh.
# The feature probes are a separate concern and stay as defense in depth for
# stripped or forked builds that advertise a current version without those flags.
# `config/backlog-backend=manual` opts out of tasks-axi for routine firstmate
# backlog mutations; `config/backlog-backend=beads` uses the federated task store
# instead. Validated secondmate handoffs always use `tasks-axi mv` when on the
# tasks-axi backend. Absent or invalid values keep the default tasks-axi backend
# path, falling back to manual mutation when the tool is not compatible.
#
# This file is the single owner of FM_TASKS_AXI_MIN. bin/fm-bootstrap.sh turns a
# failing check into the operator-facing MISSING diagnostic.
#
# COMPATIBILITY VERDICT REUSE. fm_tasks_axi_compatible costs three tasks-axi
# subprocesses, and one session start needs the same verdict twice: once in
# bin/fm-session-start.sh's backlog listing and once in the bin/fm-bootstrap.sh
# child it runs. Two reuse layers collapse that to a single probe:
#   - Within a process the first probe's answer is memoised.
#   - Across ONE process hop, a parent that already holds the verdict passes it
#     in FM_TASKS_AXI_COMPATIBLE=0|1. Sourcing this file CONSUMES that variable
#     (it is unset from the environment and kept only as a private shell
#     variable), so the verdict reaches the child that needs it and never leaks
#     onward into a spawned agent's environment, where it could outlive a
#     tasks-axi upgrade. Any value other than exactly 0 or 1 is ignored and the
#     probe runs normally.
# Both layers are bounded by process lifetime, so a tasks-axi install or upgrade
# is picked up by the next process rather than being cached to disk.

# fm_beads_resolve_or_create <task_id> [title] - beads-authority migration
# Stage 3 (see data/beads-authority-migration-scout/report.md section "Stage
# 3"): under config/backlog-backend=beads, every firstmate task must have a
# linked bead without requiring an explicit --beads flag. Looks up an
# existing OPEN bead carrying the idempotency label "task:<task_id>" first (so
# fm-brief.sh and fm-spawn.sh converge on the same bead regardless of call
# order) and mints one with that label plus the fleet label
# (fm_beads_fleet_label) only if none is found. Echoes the resolved bead id on
# success. Fails open like the rest of the beads integration: prints nothing
# and returns 1 on any missing tool or failure, never blocking dispatch.
#
# A CLOSED bead is never adopted. Task ids are reusable slugs, and
# fm-teardown.sh closes a task's bead without stripping its "task:<id>" label,
# so that record outlives the task in the federated store forever. Adopting it
# would link brand-new work to a bead that was already closed before the task
# existed - and a closed bead is the authoritative "task complete" signal
# bin/fm-crew-state.sh reads under this backend, so the fresh crew would
# reconcile as done before its worker made a single commit. Omitting --all
# leaves the store's own default filter in place, so closed predecessors are
# excluded server side and no client-side ordering or page depth can decide

# fm_beads_status <bead-id> - the single owner of reading one bead's status.
# `task show <id> --json` returns a JSON ARRAY ([{...}]), so the status lives at
# .[0].status; every other bin/ reader of a single bead unwraps it the same way
# (fm-decision-hold.sh, fm-backlog-import-beads.sh). Prints the status token to
# stdout, or nothing when the bead is absent, unreadable, or the tools are
# missing. The read is bounded by FM_BEADS_STATUS_TIMEOUT so a wedged Dolt store
# can never stall a caller on the fleet-snapshot/heartbeat path - the same
# bounded-read discipline as FM_CREW_STATE_NM_TIMEOUT / FM_SNAPSHOT_BEADS_TIMEOUT.
#
# The EXIT STATUS distinguishes the three outcomes a caller must not conflate,
# because "the bead is gone" and "the read never completed" are opposite evidence:
#   0                            the read completed; stdout is the status token
#                                (empty when the record carries none)
#   FM_BEADS_STATUS_RC_ABSENT    the read completed and the bead is not there
#   FM_BEADS_STATUS_RC_UNREADABLE  no answer: timeout, missing tool, missing
#                                bound, unparseable output, or a store that could
#                                not be reached to confirm the bead is gone
#
# `task show` exits non-zero for a missing bead AND for a store that is down,
# locked, or unauthenticated, so a failed read alone cannot distinguish them. Only
# a reachable store turns a failed read into ABSENT: fm_beads_store_reachable
# re-probes with the same `task list --limit 1` liveness predicate the write-queue
# reconcile uses, and an unreachable store keeps the outcome UNREADABLE. The probe
# is paid only on the failure path, never on a successful read.
# Stdout still fails open in every non-zero case (nothing printed), so a caller
# that only reads stdout sees "not closed" / "no evidence" rather than a
# completion; a caller deciding whether a write is already applied must check the
# status too.
#
# The bound comes from fm-timeout-lib.sh, sourced only when it is co-located:
# this library is copied on its own into partially-synced remote code roots
# (bin/fm-remote-doctor.sh, bin/fm-backlog-receive.sh both run there under
# `set -eu`), and an unguarded source would abort those scripts at load time
# instead of letting them reach the report that names what is missing. Without
# the bound, fm_beads_status refuses the read rather than running it unbounded.
