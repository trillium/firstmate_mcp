# shellcheck shell=bash
# Shared backlog backend selection (tasks-axi, beads, or manual) and tasks-axi
# compatibility probe for bootstrap, teardown, and secondmate backlog handoff.
# Usage: . bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh
#
# Compatible means tasks-axi --version reports FM_TASKS_AXI_MIN or newer,
# `tasks-axi update --help` exposes --archive-body for recoverable note rewrites,
# and `tasks-axi mv --help` exposes [<id>...] for atomic multi-ID moves required
# by secondmate handoffs.
# FM_TASKS_AXI_MIN follows the axi-family floor policy owned beside the floor
# constants in bin/fm-bootstrap.sh.
# The feature probes are a separate concern and stay as defense in depth for
# stripped or forked builds that advertise a current version without those flags.
# `config/backlog-backend=manual` opts out of tasks-axi for routine firstmate
# backlog mutations; `config/backlog-backend=beads` uses the federated task store
# instead. Validated secondmate handoffs always use `tasks-axi mv` when on the
# tasks-axi backend. Absent or invalid values keep the default tasks-axi backend
# path, falling back to manual mutation when the tool is not compatible.
#
# This file is the single owner of FM_TASKS_AXI_MIN. bin/fm-bootstrap.sh turns a
# failing check into the operator-facing MISSING diagnostic.
#
# COMPATIBILITY VERDICT REUSE. fm_tasks_axi_compatible costs three tasks-axi
# subprocesses, and one session start needs the same verdict twice: once in
# bin/fm-session-start.sh's backlog listing and once in the bin/fm-bootstrap.sh
# child it runs. Two reuse layers collapse that to a single probe:
#   - Within a process the first probe's answer is memoised.
#   - Across ONE process hop, a parent that already holds the verdict passes it
#     in FM_TASKS_AXI_COMPATIBLE=0|1. Sourcing this file CONSUMES that variable
#     (it is unset from the environment and kept only as a private shell
#     variable), so the verdict reaches the child that needs it and never leaks
#     onward into a spawned agent's environment, where it could outlive a
#     tasks-axi upgrade. Any value other than exactly 0 or 1 is ignored and the
#     probe runs normally.
# Both layers are bounded by process lifetime, so a tasks-axi install or upgrade
# is picked up by the next process rather than being cached to disk.

# --- Beads store provisioning and Dolt sync (config/backlog-backend=beads only) ---
#
# Every function below is inert on the tasks-axi and manual backends: callers
# gate on fm_backlog_backend_value before invoking them, and none of them runs
# unless a `task` CLI is on PATH. The beads store stays the single write
# authority throughout; provisioning only creates a store where none answers,
# and sync only moves that store's own commits to and from a Dolt remote the
# operator configured, exactly the availability-not-authority doctrine
# bin/fm-beads-resilience-lib.sh states for the mirror and write queue.
#
# STORE RESOLUTION IS THE CLI'S JOB, NOT FIRSTMATE'S. The `task` wrapper pins
# BEADS_DIR for the whole federation, so firstmate never derives, guesses, or
# hardcodes a store path; it asks the CLI whether the store answers and reports
# what it says. That is why a home with no local .beads/ directory is not
# evidence of a missing store: the shared store the wrapper points at can live
# anywhere, including a Dolt sql-server this host merely connects to.

# fm_beads_store_reachable - true when the beads store answers a cheap read.
# This, not the presence of a .beads/ directory, is the store-usable test.
#
# The optional bound is for callers running under a deadline. A Dolt sql-server
# that accepts the connection and then never answers makes this read hang, so a
# caller whose whole budget this probe precedes must pass a bound or the budget
# is not the bound it claims to be. A store that does not answer within it is a

# because "the bead is gone" and "the read never completed" are opposite evidence:
#   0                            the read completed; stdout is the status token
#                                (empty when the record carries none)
#   FM_BEADS_STATUS_RC_ABSENT    the read completed and the bead is not there
#   FM_BEADS_STATUS_RC_UNREADABLE  no answer: timeout, missing tool, missing
#                                bound, unparseable output, or a store that could
#                                not be reached to confirm the bead is gone
#
# `task show` exits non-zero for a missing bead AND for a store that is down,
# locked, or unauthenticated, so a failed read alone cannot distinguish them. Only
# a reachable store turns a failed read into ABSENT: fm_beads_store_reachable
# re-probes with the same `task list --limit 1` liveness predicate the write-queue
# reconcile uses, and an unreachable store keeps the outcome UNREADABLE. The probe
# is paid only on the failure path, never on a successful read.
# Stdout still fails open in every non-zero case (nothing printed), so a caller
# that only reads stdout sees "not closed" / "no evidence" rather than a
# completion; a caller deciding whether a write is already applied must check the
# status too.
#
# The bound comes from fm-timeout-lib.sh, sourced only when it is co-located:
# this library is copied on its own into partially-synced remote code roots
# (bin/fm-remote-doctor.sh, bin/fm-backlog-receive.sh both run there under
# `set -eu`), and an unguarded source would abort those scripts at load time
# instead of letting them reach the report that names what is missing. Without
# the bound, fm_beads_status refuses the read rather than running it unbounded.

# fm_beads_store_reachable is defined once, above, as the single owner of the

# gates its whole replay on. It takes an OPTIONAL bound rather than always
# applying one, because its two callers need opposite defaults: the read below
# must never stall the heartbeat and so passes FM_BEADS_STATUS_TIMEOUT
# explicitly, while fm_beads_bootstrap_store's refuse-over-a-live-store guard
# must not read a merely slow store as absent and so stays unbounded. Making
# the bound explicit per call site keeps both guarantees instead of picking a
# default that silently breaks one of them.

# fm_beads_is_closed <bead-id> - true ONLY when the bead exists and its status is
# closed. This is the authoritative task-completion signal read by
# bin/fm-crew-state.sh under config/backlog-backend=beads: the worker closes its
# linked bead as the terminal lifecycle step before reporting done, and
# fm-teardown.sh/fm-ledger.sh close it on confirmed landing or drop-recovery, so a
# closed bead means the task is complete regardless of a stale status-event tail.
# Distinct from fm-beads-resilience-lib.sh's fm_beads_close_already_applied, which
# treats an ABSENT bead as "already applied" for idempotent write-queue replay:
# here an absent, open, or unreadable bead is NOT closed, so reconciliation falls
# through to the existing pane/run-step logic rather than inventing a completion.
# Reads status through fm_beads_status (the one array-unwrap owner) and treats
# every non-zero read - absent bead as much as an unanswered one - as "not
# closed", so it fails open the same way and never marks live work done.
