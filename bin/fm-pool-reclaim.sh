#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-pool-reclaim.sh - reclaim treehouse pool slots that no live task owns.
#
# Why this exists: a treehouse pool only shrinks. `treehouse prune` skips any
# worktree with uncommitted changes, and a `--lease` is durable by contract -
# never handed out again and never pruned, even with nothing running inside it,
# until an explicit `treehouse return`. So every crew endpoint that dies without
# reaching bin/fm-teardown.sh (killed window, lost machine, context blowout)
# leaks its slot permanently. Slots accumulate until `treehouse get` has nothing
# to hand out and bin/fm-spawn.sh fails with "treehouse get did not enter a
# worktree within 60s".
#
# Two leak shapes are reclaimable without judgment, and this script reclaims
# only those two:
#
#   stale lease   status=leased, zero processes, leased longer ago than the
#                 staleness threshold. Returned with `--if-lease-id`, so a lease
#                 re-acquired between the status read and the return is refused
#                 by treehouse rather than stolen.
#   spent slot    status=dirty, unleased, zero processes, and every dirty path
#                 is one firstmate itself wrote (the per-spawn hook droppings in
#                 DROPPINGS below, which fm-teardown.sh removes). Such a slot
#                 holds no work: the dirt IS the removal of our own hook file,
#                 which reads as an uncommitted deletion whenever the path is
#                 tracked at the worktree's HEAD.
#
# Everything else is left alone and reported: a worktree with any dirty path
# outside DROPPINGS may hold unlanded work, and reclaiming it would run
# `treehouse return --force`, which resets. Triage those by hand.
#
# Fail-open by design, matching bin/fm-staleness-file.sh: this runs as a
# best-effort pre-flight from bin/fm-spawn.sh, so a missing treehouse, an
# unparseable status, or a refused return warns on stderr and still exits 0. A
# reclaim problem must never be the reason a spawn fails.
#
# Usage: fm-pool-reclaim.sh [--project <dir>] [--yes] [--only-if-exhausted]
#                           [--stale-lease-secs <n>]
#   --project <dir>          Directory whose pool to sweep (default: cwd).
#                            treehouse resolves the pool from this directory.
#   --yes                    Perform the returns. Without it this is a dry run
#                            that prints exactly what it would reclaim.
#   --only-if-exhausted      Do nothing unless the pool has no available slot.
#                            The spawn pre-flight in bin/fm-spawn.sh uses this so
#                            an ordinary spawn with a slot free pays no sweep.
#   --stale-lease-secs <n>   Age past which a process-free lease counts as
#                            abandoned (default: $FM_POOL_STALE_LEASE_SECS, else
#                            7200). Guards the window between `treehouse get
#                            --lease` and the leaseholder's first process.
