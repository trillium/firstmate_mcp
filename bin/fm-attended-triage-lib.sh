# Attended background triage: the sub-supervisor's second, smarter pass over the
# durable wake queue while the captain is PRESENT (state/.afk ABSENT).
#
# WHY. The always-on watcher's triage is deliberately cheap and pattern-only, so
# it enqueues anything it cannot positively call benign. Every one of those
# records then costs the main firstmate session a turn. This library lets the
# already-running sub-supervisor spend a small, bounded amount of a cheap model's
# attention on the records the pattern rules did NOT positively classify, and
# drop the ones that provably need nobody. Absorption is the entire point: it is
# what frees the main session.
#
# WHAT ATTENDED MODE IS. Attended triage differs from away mode in exactly one
# way - what it does with a wake that must reach the captain:
#   away     buffer it and inject the marked away-supervisor escalation
#            (bin/fm-operational-input.sh contract, owned by the daemon).
#   attended LEAVE it on the durable wake queue, untouched, so the main session
#            surfaces it at the top of its next turn exactly as today.
# Attended mode NEVER injects operational input. The captain is already present,
# and a marked/unmarked mixup in an attended session is precisely the away-mode
# exit hazard; nothing here touches that discrimination.
#
# TWO TIERS, ONE DIRECTION. Tier 1 is the existing shared verb/regex classifier
# (bin/fm-classify-lib.sh) plus the never-absorb rules below. Tier 1 can only
# ever FORCE AN ESCALATION; it is authoritative and the model can never override
# it. Tier 2 asks a cheap model, and absorption requires that model's affirmative
# `absorb`. So every degraded path - no binary, non-zero exit, timeout, empty or
# unparseable answer, call cap reached, feature disabled - lands on escalate,
# which is byte-for-byte today's behavior. The model call is strictly
# non-load-bearing: a missing model can never wedge or silence supervision.
#
# NEVER ABSORB. Independent of the model, these always escalate:
#   * any done:/needs-decision:/blocked:/failed: verb, in the wake payload or in
#     the task's own last status line;
#   * any Relay mention or Relay configuration error check;
#   * any merged-PR or checks-green result;
#   * any staleness auto-close reclaim;
#   * any wake for a task that still has an OPEN keyed decision record;
#   * any heartbeat (the fleet-wide catch-all backstop: a single record carries
#     no evidence about the fleet it is asking firstmate to review, so its
#     routineness is not judgeable here);
#   * any wake whose kind or key this library does not recognise.
#
# SWITCH. Off unless the captain turns it on; see docs/configuration.md
# "Attended background triage (config/attended-triage)".

You are triaging one background notification for an autonomous software fleet
supervisor. The supervisor's human captain is present and busy; a notification
that reaches them costs them an interruption.

Answer with exactly one word, then a short reason on the same line:
  escalate <reason>   the captain must see this now
  absorb <reason>     nobody needs to act on this

Escalate whenever you are unsure. Absorb only routine progress noise: a worker
that is plainly still working, a repeat of something already reported, a
notification with no actionable content.
