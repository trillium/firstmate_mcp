# Shared "is this git lock file provably abandoned?" decision procedure.
#
# ONE owner for the staleness proof that fm-teardown.sh (a worktree index.lock)
# and fm-fleet-sync.sh (a clone's .git/packed-refs.lock) both rely on: a lock is
# provably stale iff ALL of the following hold -
#   1. the lock file still exists;
#   2. no live process holds the lock file open, and none holds a companion
#      directory (the worktree, or the repo's .git dir) open as cwd or an fd -
#      a live git process keeps its own lock open for the whole operation, so an
#      empty lsof result means the file was abandoned, not that no one held it;
#   3. its mtime age is at least a caller-supplied threshold - a freshly created
#      lock might belong to a process lsof has not yet reflected.
# ANY uncertainty - lsof missing, an lsof error, an unreadable mtime - returns
# non-zero (NOT stale): fail safe, never remove a lock that cannot be proven dead.
# Diagnostics print to stderr prefixed by ${FM_LOCK_LOG_PREFIX:-fm-lock} so each
# caller's output stays recognizable.
#
# This leaf also owns HOW `lsof` itself is located (fm_lsof_bin), because it is
# the shared lsof consumer: fm-teardown.sh's leaked-process reaper resolves the
# binary through the same function so one host can never answer "is lsof here?"
# two different ways.

# Resolution is deliberately NOT PATH-only. On macOS lsof ships solely as
# /usr/sbin/lsof - there is no /usr/bin/lsof and Homebrew installs none - so any
# session whose PATH omits /usr/sbin (agent shells routinely have exactly
# ~/.local/bin:~/.bun/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin) read as
# "this host has no lsof" and silently took the degraded path: teardown stopped
# reaping processes leaked under the task worktree - the exact incident the
# reaper exists for - and every git lock read as live (robots-8d5r).
#
# PATH still wins when it has one, so a package-manager lsof or a test stub is
# unaffected; the standard system locations are only a fallback.
# FM_LSOF_FALLBACK_DIRS (space-separated; set it empty to disable the fallback)
# overrides those locations so tests can model a host with no lsof anywhere.
