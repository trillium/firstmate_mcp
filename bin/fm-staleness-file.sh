# backstop because its worktree still holds unlanded work. Called only from
# bin/fm-teardown.sh's staleness_chat_only_teardown, after work_is_landed has
# already returned false for the task's branch.
# Fail-open by design, matching bin/fm-bead-stamp.sh: a missing `staleness` CLI
# or a create call it rejects warns on stderr and exits 0 so a triage-filing
# problem never blocks or fails the reclaim that is already under way.
