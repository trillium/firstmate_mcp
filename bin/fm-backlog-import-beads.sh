# fm-backlog-import-beads.sh - one-time forward importer from data/backlog.md to
# the beads federated task store (beads-authority migration Stage 6; see
# data/beads-authority-migration-scout/report.md section 4 "Stage 6").
#
# It walks the active home's data/backlog.md `## In flight` and `## Queued`
# sections and creates one bead per item in the active beads store, so a home
# can flip config/backlog-backend to beads without losing its live queue. The
# `## Done` section is historical record and is never migrated.
#
# Mapping:
#   - `## In flight` item  -> bead status in_progress
#   - `## Queued` item     -> bead status open (bd's default)
#   - `(priority: N)`      -> bead priority N (beads' 0-4 scale, passed through)
#   - a captain-held decision thread (`(hold-kind: captain)` or `(kind: captain)`)
#     -> the Stage 4 beads-native mechanism via `bin/fm-decision-hold.sh hold`
#        (a labeled anchor bead plus a `task gate create --type=human`), NOT a
#        status hack. The backlog id must follow the `<origin>-decision-<key>`
#        convention that fm-decision-hold.sh owns, and the origin must be present
#        in the active home (its state/<origin>.meta or data/<origin>/report.md);
#        otherwise the item fails closed rather than migrating incorrectly.
#   - `blocked-by: <id>` (one or more) -> a real beads dependency edge, wired in
#     a second pass after every bead exists so a blocker defined later in the
#     file still resolves (`task dep <blocker-bead> --blocks <item-bead>`). The
#     reference is kept in the description too, so nothing is dropped.
#   - a clearly-dated queued time gate `(since <YYYY-MM-DD>)` -> the bead's defer
#     date (`task update --defer`), so the bead stays hidden from `task ready`
#     until then. beads' own semantics handle either meaning: a past date leaves
#     the bead ready now (age marker), a future date withholds it (time gate).
#   - the item's FIRST line, cut at its first trailing metadata marker, inline
#     note, or URL -> the bead's single-line title; an indented continuation line
#     never reaches the title field (extract_title below owns the exact cut).
#   - the full item text (title-line metadata plus indented continuation lines)
#     -> the bead's description, so nothing is dropped.
#
# Every created bead carries the firstmate-fleet label (fm_beads_fleet_label)
# so `task list --label <fleet>` scopes to firstmate's fleet, and the
# home-scoped task:<scope>:<id> idempotency label that fm_beads_resolve_or_create
# already uses, so re-running the importer resolves the bead THIS home created
# instead of duplicating it. That idempotency only reaches back as far as the
# home-scoped label: a bead an older importer created before the label was
# home-scoped carries the unscoped task:<id> label and stays invisible to the
# lookup. Bootstrap's one-shot migration rescues such beads only for tasks this
# home had already dispatched or briefed; an item that exists only in the backlog
# queue and was never briefed or dispatched is not a migration candidate. Captain
# holds are idempotent through fm-decision-hold.sh's own `hold:<id>` anchor
# lookup.
#
# Modes:
#   (default)   Dry run. Prints what it WOULD create and whether each item
#               already exists in the store, and makes no writes.
#   --apply     Perform the writes. Idempotent: safe to re-run after a partial
#               failure; already-imported items are resolved, not duplicated.
#
# The importer fails closed if the beads CLI or store is unreachable, and aborts
# loudly on any write failure rather than migrating part of the backlog
# silently. A partial run leaves already-created beads in place; fix the cause
# and re-run --apply to converge.
#
# This importer deliberately does NOT flip config/backlog-backend; that file is
# local and per-home. The intended operator sequence is:
#   1. fm-backlog-import-beads.sh                 # dry run, review the plan
#   2. fm-backlog-import-beads.sh --apply         # perform the import
#   3. printf 'beads\n' > "$FM_HOME/config/backlog-backend"   # flip the backend
# See docs/configuration.md "Backlog backend" for the surrounding contract.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-backlog-import-beads.sh [--backlog <path>] [--apply]
#   fm-backlog-import-beads.sh --help
#
#   --backlog <path>  Read this backlog file instead of $FM_HOME/data/backlog.md
#                     (used by tests against a fixture; never touch a live store).
#   --apply           Perform the import. Without it the importer only previews.
