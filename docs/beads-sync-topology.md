# Beads store topology and sync destination

This document is the reasoning behind how a beads-backed fleet shares one task store, and it ends in a decision the captain owns.
[`docs/configuration.md`](configuration.md) "Backlog backend" is the owner of the resulting configuration and mechanics; this file only explains why that shape was chosen and what remains unconfigured.

## The state this was written against

Under `config/backlog-backend=beads` the store is reached through the federation's `task` wrapper, which pins `BEADS_DIR` at `~/data/tasks/.beads` before executing `bd`.
Store resolution is therefore the CLI's job, not firstmate's, and a firstmate home with no local `.beads/` directory is not evidence of a missing store.
Every home on one machine shares that single pinned store, so local secondmate homes need no provisioning of their own.

As of 2026-08-12 the main store had no Dolt remote (`task dolt remote list` was empty) and no federation peers (`task federation list-peers` reported none).
`~/data/tasks` is itself a git repository, but it has no git remote, so `bd bootstrap`'s "clone the Dolt data that rides `refs/dolt/data` on the git origin" path has no origin to clone from.
The store runs in Dolt server mode on `127.0.0.1:3307`, which is why there is no `.beads/dolt/` directory on disk to copy.

The practical consequence is that the fleet's task store is single-machine today.
It is durable against a lost home, because every home on the machine points at the same store, and not durable against a lost machine.

## Options considered

| Option | Off-box durability | Write authority | What it costs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A. Dolt remote on a designated git remote | Yes, once a destination exists | One, the local store | Publishes task data to that destination |
| B. `bd federation` peers over Tailscale | Only while a peer is up | Several, one per peer | Split-brain risk plus SQL credentials and reachable servers |
| C. Remote homes dial the main Dolt server | No, it is the same store | One, the main store | Binding Dolt beyond loopback, and nothing works while the laptop is off |

Option A is the shape beads itself is built around: issues live in a local Dolt database, and sync rides `refs/dolt/data` on an ordinary git remote, with `.beads/issues.jsonl` remaining a passive export rather than a sync mechanism.
It keeps exactly one write authority, which matters because the backlog is the record firstmate dispatches from, and a divergent second authority would silently duplicate or lose work items.

Option B trades that single authority away.
Peers each hold a writable database, so two homes editing the same bead produce a genuine conflict that a background sweep cannot resolve on its own.
It also needs each peer to run a reachable Dolt server with credentials, which is a larger security surface than a fetch and push against a remote the captain already trusts.

Option C is not really sync at all, since the remote homes would share the laptop's store rather than hold their own copy.
It removes divergence entirely, but it requires binding Dolt past loopback and leaves every remote home with no backlog whenever the laptop is asleep, which is exactly when unattended remote work runs.

## Recommendation

Use option A, a Dolt remote on a private git remote that the captain designates, and keep the local store as the single write authority with sync as a durability and availability step.

The destination is the captain's decision and has not been made, so no remote is configured.
Adding a Dolt remote publishes the task store to that destination, and the store carries the fleet's own working notes, so firstmate does not choose where that lands.
Until a destination is approved, the routine sync sweep reports that the store is single-machine only and does nothing else.

The captain needs to answer one question: which git remote should hold the fleet's task data.
A private repository the captain already owns is the expected answer, and a self-hosted or LAN-only Dolt remote is equally workable if publishing to a hosted forge is unwanted.

## Provisioning a machine that has no store

The gap this leaves is per-machine, not per-home.
A remote account that has never run beads has no store and often no `task` wrapper, so every beads read there fails with "no beads database found" even when a store directory exists.
[`bin/fm-remote-doctor.sh`](../bin/fm-remote-doctor.sh) owns that repair as its `beads-store` check, and [`docs/remote-secondmates.md`](remote-secondmates.md) owns the operator sequence.

Provisioning always uses `bd bootstrap`, which is the non-destructive verb; `bd init --force` is never run against a store.
Firstmate additionally refuses to bootstrap whenever the store already answers a read, because bootstrap's own detection inspects the `.beads/` directory and reports a healthy Dolt server-mode store as absent, which would create a fresh empty database beside the live one.

Once a destination is approved, a machine provisioned this way inherits the fleet's history through that remote rather than starting an island store.
Until then, a newly provisioned machine holds its own independent store, which is why the sync sweep names the single-machine posture out loud rather than passing silently.
