# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute.
Pull requests targeting `main` land through a plain direct-PR flow: branch, validate locally, push, and open a PR.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo and clone your fork, or set your local `origin` to your fork.
2. Create a branch and make your changes.
3. Validate locally: run `bin/fm-lint.sh` and the relevant `tests/*.test.sh` (see "Development" for the full toolbelt).
4. Commit your changes.
5. Push your branch to your fork and open a PR against `main`.

CI runs `bin/fm-lint.sh` plus the behavior and platform test lanes on every PR; keep those green.

## Repo conventions

- This repo is a template for running a firstmate orchestrator agent.
  `AGENTS.md` is the agent's main job description and names when to load bundled firstmate skills; `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it, and `.claude/skills` is a symlink to `.agents/skills`.
- Only shared material is tracked: `AGENTS.md`, `persona.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.tasks.toml`, `.github/workflows/`, `bin/`, `.agents/skills/`, and `skills/`.
  `.agents/skills/` holds agent-loaded skills that assume a live firstmate home and carry `metadata.internal: true` so installers such as [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) hide them from discovery; `skills/` holds standalone, installer-facing public skills with no firstmate dependency (see the README's "Two-tier skill layout").
  Everything personal to one captain's fleet (`.env`, `data/`, `state/`, `config/`, `projects/`, `.no-mistakes/`) is gitignored; never commit it.
  The root `.tasks.toml` is tracked `tasks-axi` config for `data/backlog.md`; compatible `tasks-axi` is the default backend for routine backlog mutations, with the compatibility definition owned by [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md) ("Backlog backend").
  A local `config/backlog-backend=manual` opt-out forces firstmate's routine backlog updates to hand-editing; a local `config/backlog-backend=beads` uses the federated task store instead. Both stay gitignored; validated secondmate handoffs delegate through `tasks-axi mv` when on the tasks-axi backend.
  A local `config/backend` file explicitly overrides runtime auto-detection for new task endpoints and stays gitignored; spawn-supported values are `tmux` plus experimental `herdr`, `zellij`, `orca`, and `cmux`, while `codex-app` is documented only in `docs/codex-app-backend.md`.
  It does not make `data/` tracked.
- Helper scripts in `bin/` are plain bash.
  Each starts with a usage header comment; keep it accurate when you change behavior.
  Test scripts and helpers in `tests/` are plain bash too.
  `bin/fm-lint.sh` must pass: it is the single owner of the lint definition (the shellcheck file set, config, and pinned shellcheck version), and both CI and the no-mistakes pre-push gate run it, so local and CI can never diverge.
  It pins one exact shellcheck version and refuses to run under any other; print it with `bin/fm-lint.sh --required-version` and install that build locally.
- Harness-adapter ownership spans detection in `bin/fm-harness.sh`, launch and hook mechanics in `bin/fm-spawn.sh`, semantic busy sources and trust gates in `bin/fm-busy-lib.sh`, delivery-only rendered guards in `bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh`, cleanup in `bin/fm-teardown.sh`, and facts in `.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md`; the `firstmate-coding-guidelines` skill owns the validation policy for checks that depend on those harnesses.
- Changes to runtime session backends (`bin/fm-backend.sh`, `bin/backends/`, and the scripts that dispatch through them) keep current setup and limits in the relevant backend guide and active empirical evidence in [`docs/verification/runtime-backends.md`](docs/verification/runtime-backends.md).
- [`docs/documentation-audiences.md`](docs/documentation-audiences.md) and its machine-consumed inventory own prose classification; run `bin/fm-doc-audience-check.sh` after documentation changes.
- In Markdown, put each full sentence on its own line.
- `README.md` stays a concise overview plus pointers: it never carries a wall of inline detail.
  Route detail to the most specific `docs/` file (architecture, configuration, or a backend guide) and link to it instead.

## Development

Tracked changes to firstmate itself - `AGENTS.md`, `persona.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.tasks.toml`, `.github/workflows/`, `bin/`, `.agents/skills/`, and `skills/` - ship as a plain direct-PR on a feature branch and require an explicit merge approval.
Before making any such change, load the agent-only `firstmate-coding-guidelines` skill (`.agents/skills/firstmate-coding-guidelines/SKILL.md`).
It has the knowledge-placement rules that keep `AGENTS.md` from regrowing after each diet pass.
There is no reliable way for `bin/fm-brief.sh`'s scaffold to detect that a task's repo is firstmate itself, so firstmate adds this skill's load line to firstmate-repo briefs by hand.
A crewmate picking up such a brief should load the skill even if the brief predates this instruction.
When supervising live crewmates, keep firstmate's own long validation or build commands in the background so watcher wakes can still be handled.
Local `.no-mistakes/` state and test evidence stay out of this repo; it is gitignored, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` rejects tracked entries under that path.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` owns the broad behavior suite plus platform-specific compatibility lanes.

Check and test the toolbelt before pushing:

```sh
while IFS= read -r script; do /bin/bash -n "$script" || exit; done < <(bin/fm-lint.sh --list-files)   # syntax-check the canonical shell surface
bin/fm-lint.sh   # lint the toolbelt and behavior tests; the single owner CI and the no-mistakes gate both run
bash tests/fork-features.sh   # fork feature guard suite (must pass to prevent silent feature drops during upstream reconciles)
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/<subject>.test.sh   # one script (primary local focus path, timed)
bin/fm-test-run.sh --family pure-contract-unit   # ordinary family-scoped local path (serial, timed)
bin/fm-test-run.sh --changed   # conservative changed-file-informed set (never silent full suite)
bin/fm-test-run.sh --proven-isolated --jobs 4   # explicit local parallel of the proven set only (default is serial)
bin/fm-test-run.sh --lane portable-serial   # portable serial remainder (watcher/AFK/tmux/stateful)
bin/fm-test-run.sh --list-lanes   # discover exact lane names, including the current CI serial shards
bin/fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage   # prove portable shards + serial + serial shards + Herdr equal the full inventory
bin/fm-test-run.sh --all   # deliberate complete regression (optional local full walk; not no-mistakes Test)
bin/fm-test-isolation-proof.sh --list   # proven parallel candidate set (Phase 2 owner)
bin/fm-test-isolation-proof.sh --jobs 4 --json /tmp/fm-isolation-proof.json   # re-run concurrent isolation proof only
[ "$(readlink CLAUDE.md)" = "AGENTS.md" ]
[ "$(readlink .claude/skills)" = "../.agents/skills" ]
tmp=$(mktemp -d) && printf 'done: smoke\n' > "$tmp/smoke.status" && FM_STATE_OVERRIDE="$tmp" FM_SIGNAL_GRACE=1 FM_POLL=1 FM_HEARTBEAT=999999 bin/fm-watch-arm.sh  # watcher re-arm smoke test (prints arm status, then an actionable signal)
```

`bin/fm-test-run.sh` is the single owner of behavior-suite selection, portable CI lane composition, optional local `--jobs` for the proven-isolated set only, per-script timing markers, family totals, the coverage guard, and the optional JSON timing artifact.
Its header and `--help` own the flags, family labels, lanes, and changed-file map; this section only documents the entry points.
`bin/fm-test-isolation-proof.sh` remains the single owner of the Phase 2 concurrent isolation proof and the exact proven candidate set; see `docs/fm-test-isolation-proof.md`.
Portable shard balance evidence lives in `docs/fm-test-portable-shards.md`.
Family selection is the ordinary local path; `--all` is deliberate full regression only.
CI owns broad regression across required portable parallel shards, the portable serial lane's separate-runner shards, the Herdr lane, lint, invariants, the coverage guard, and stock macOS Bash compatibility in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
Use `bin/fm-test-run.sh --list-lanes` for exact lane names and `--help` for `--jobs` rules and required gate-skip flags when reproducing a lane locally.
Discover tests by listing `tests/*.test.sh`: each is a self-contained bash script named `<subject>.test.sh`, and its header comment describes what it covers, so pass one to `bin/fm-test-run.sh` to focus on a subject with canonical timing output.
Tests that need a real optional backend or an explicit opt-in (real herdr/zellij/cmux smoke tests, the live Pi regression) skip themselves and print the tool or environment gate needed to enable them, so the portable suite remains safe on machines without those tools.
The [Herdr backend guide](docs/herdr-backend.md#destructive-lab-safety) owns the lane's isolation boundary, while [runtime backend verification](docs/verification/runtime-backends.md#herdr) owns active empirical evidence; live harness credential tests remain opt-in.
