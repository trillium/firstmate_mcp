# shellcheck shell=bash
# bin/fm-beads-resilience-lib.sh - local mirror and durable write queue that
# keep the beads backlog backend (config/backlog-backend=beads) from wedging
# firstmate during a Dolt/beads-store outage.
# Usage: . bin/fm-beads-resilience-lib.sh
#
# Read-side mirror (beads-authority-migration Stage 5, report.md section 5):
#   fm_beads_mirror_write <view> <raw-output>   - opportunistic side effect of
#     a successful `task ...` read already performed by a caller (session-start's
#     compact listing, fm-fleet-snapshot.sh). No code path polls beads solely
#     to refresh this file, same discipline as
#     state/.last-watcher-beat. <view> is a short slug (e.g. "ready", "fleet")
#     naming which read this is a mirror of; each view gets its own file.
#   fm_beads_mirror_read <view>     - prints the last mirrored raw output for
#     <view> to stdout and sets FM_BEADS_MIRROR_WRITTEN_AT to its epoch
#     timestamp; returns 1 if no mirror exists yet or it is unreadable.
#   fm_beads_mirror_age_seconds <view>   - prints the mirror's age in seconds;
#     returns 1 if absent.
#   fm_beads_mirror_fresh <view> [<max-age-seconds>]   - true if a mirror
#     exists and is no older than <max-age-seconds> (default
#     FM_BEADS_MIRROR_MAX_AGE, 900s / 15min).
#   fm_beads_mirror_timestamp_iso <view>   - prints the mirror's write time as
#     a UTC ISO-8601 timestamp, for the "(stale mirror, beads store
#     unreachable since <ts>)" label callers prefix onto stale output.
# A mirror file is never presented as current: every caller that falls back to
# one must label the output as a stale mirror (AGENTS.md section 3's ABSENT-
# file discipline extended to "unreachable-store" fallback data).
#
# Write-side durable queue (report.md section 5 write-queue design):
#   fm_beads_write_enqueue <task-id> <description> <task-argv...>   - append a
#     failed `task <task-argv...>` write to the durable queue for later
#     replay. Beads remains sole write authority; the queue is availability,
#     not a second authority, and never resolves conflicts itself - replay is
#     strict FIFO, and a write that no longer applies cleanly is left for
#     whatever `task` itself reports on replay rather than reconciled locally,
#     with one narrow exception: fm_beads_write_queue_reconcile's close check
#     below.
#   fm_beads_write_queue_count      - prints the number of queued writes.
#   fm_beads_write_queue_reconcile   - replays every queued write against the
#     live store, dropping ones that succeed and re-queuing ones that still
#     fail; prints one BEADS_WRITE_QUEUE: line per outcome plus a summary
#     line; returns 0 only when the queue drains completely. A queued `close`
#     write whose replay fails is checked with fm_beads_close_already_applied
#     (a `task show <id> --json` reporting the bead absent or status=closed)
#     before being re-queued, so a bead the outage's original close (or
#     someone else) already closed is reconciled instead of retried forever;
#     every other write kind still leaves a genuine replay failure re-queued
#     as-is. Call sites that currently warn-and-continue on a failed beads
#     write (fm-teardown.sh's close_linked_bead, fm-bead-stamp.sh) enqueue on
#     failure instead of only warning, preserving their existing fail-open
#     posture. Called from fm-bootstrap.sh's mutating sweep block (beads
#     backend only) so an outage recovers on the next session-start bootstrap
#     without a new polling loop.
#
# Both mirror files (state/.beads-mirror-<view>.json) and the write queue
# (state/.beads-write-queue) are private runtime state (AGENTS.md section 2)
# and reuse bin/fm-wake-lib.sh's portable symlink-based lock and durable
# append/drain pattern rather than reimplementing it.
