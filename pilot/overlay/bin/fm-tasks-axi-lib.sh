# shellcheck shell=bash
# Shared backlog backend selection (tasks-axi, beads, or manual) and tasks-axi
# compatibility probe for bootstrap, teardown, and secondmate backlog handoff.
# Usage: . bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh
#
# Compatible means tasks-axi --version reports FM_TASKS_AXI_MIN or newer,
# `tasks-axi update --help` exposes --archive-body for recoverable note rewrites,
# and `tasks-axi mv --help` exposes [<id>...] for atomic multi-ID moves required
# by secondmate handoffs.
# FM_TASKS_AXI_MIN follows the axi-family floor policy owned beside the floor
# constants in bin/fm-bootstrap.sh.
# The feature probes are a separate concern and stay as defense in depth for
# stripped or forked builds that advertise a current version without those flags.
# `config/backlog-backend=manual` opts out of tasks-axi for routine firstmate
# backlog mutations; `config/backlog-backend=beads` uses the federated task store
# instead. Validated secondmate handoffs always use `tasks-axi mv` when on the
# tasks-axi backend. Absent or invalid values keep the default tasks-axi backend
# path, falling back to manual mutation when the tool is not compatible.
#
# This file is the single owner of FM_TASKS_AXI_MIN. bin/fm-bootstrap.sh turns a
# failing check into the operator-facing MISSING diagnostic.
#
# COMPATIBILITY VERDICT REUSE. fm_tasks_axi_compatible costs three tasks-axi
# subprocesses, and one session start needs the same verdict twice: once in
# bin/fm-session-start.sh's backlog listing and once in the bin/fm-bootstrap.sh
# child it runs. Two reuse layers collapse that to a single probe:
#   - Within a process the first probe's answer is memoised.
#   - Across ONE process hop, a parent that already holds the verdict passes it
#     in FM_TASKS_AXI_COMPATIBLE=0|1. Sourcing this file CONSUMES that variable
#     (it is unset from the environment and kept only as a private shell
#     variable), so the verdict reaches the child that needs it and never leaks
#     onward into a spawned agent's environment, where it could outlive a
#     tasks-axi upgrade. Any value other than exactly 0 or 1 is ignored and the
#     probe runs normally.
# Both layers are bounded by process lifetime, so a tasks-axi install or upgrade
# is picked up by the next process rather than being cached to disk.

# --- Beads store provisioning and Dolt sync (config/backlog-backend=beads only) ---
#
# Every function below is inert on the tasks-axi and manual backends: callers
# gate on fm_backlog_backend_value before invoking them, and none of them runs
# unless a `task` CLI is on PATH. The beads store stays the single write
# authority throughout; provisioning only creates a store where none answers,
# and sync only moves that store's own commits to and from a Dolt remote the
# operator configured, exactly the availability-not-authority doctrine
# bin/fm-beads-resilience-lib.sh states for the mirror and write queue.
#
# STORE RESOLUTION IS THE CLI'S JOB, NOT FIRSTMATE'S. The `task` wrapper pins
# BEADS_DIR for the whole federation, so firstmate never derives, guesses, or
# hardcodes a store path; it asks the CLI whether the store answers and reports
# what it says. That is why a home with no local .beads/ directory is not
# evidence of a missing store: the shared store the wrapper points at can live
# anywhere, including a Dolt sql-server this host merely connects to.

# fm_beads_store_reachable - true when the beads store answers a cheap read.
# This, not the presence of a .beads/ directory, is the store-usable test.
#
# The optional bound is for callers running under a deadline. A Dolt sql-server
# that accepts the connection and then never answers makes this read hang, so a
# caller whose whole budget this probe precedes must pass a bound or the budget
# is not the bound it claims to be. A store that does not answer within it is a

# fm_beads_home_scope - the stable per-home scope that keeps the task:<id>
# idempotency label distinct across firstmate homes sharing one beads store.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. The beads store is machine-wide: the federation `task` wrapper
# pins one BEADS_DIR for every home, and config/backlog-backend is inherited by
# secondmate homes, so the primary and every secondmate resolve against one
# store while picking task slugs from independent per-home backlogs. A label
# keyed only on the task slug (task:<id>) is therefore identical across homes:
# home B reusing a slug home A already used adopts A's bead, and A closing its
# bead marks B's live work done. Home-scoping the label is the only fix that
# keeps two homes' beads distinct, which is also why ANDing the shared
# fleet:firstmate label into the lookup is NOT sufficient - every home shares
# that label too.
#
# DERIVATION. The home path is the home's own durable identity, read fresh from
# FM_HOME exactly as fm_backend_herdr_workspace_label does: it is stable across
# restarts and distinct per FM_HOME by construction. SHA-256 of that path,
# truncated to 16 hex chars, keeps the label short and readable while making a
# collision across a small fleet effectively impossible. The shasum/sha256sum
# fallback matches the established pattern in fm-decision-hold.sh and
# fm-remote-home-provision.sh, and the scope is lowercase hex so it is a legal
# label character class and never contains a comma (labels are comma-separated).
#
# NORMALIZATION. The hash is taken over the home's PHYSICAL path, not the string
# a caller happened to pass. FM_HOME reaches this library through several call
# paths that do not canonicalize it (fm-brief.sh and fm-spawn.sh pass an absolute
# path through unchanged, fm-backlog-import-beads.sh does not resolve it at all),
# so '/x/home', '/x/home/', a relative spelling, and a symlinked spelling all name
# one home while hashing to four different scopes - which would strand the intake
# bead fm-brief.sh minted where fm-spawn.sh cannot find it, mint a duplicate, and
# leave the first bead open forever because teardown only closes the meta's id.

# fm_beads_migrate_legacy_task_labels - the ONE-SHOT migration off the
# pre-home-scoping task:<task_id> label onto task:<home-scope>:<task_id>.
#
# WHY A SWEEP AND NOT A COMPATIBILITY READ. Resolving the legacy label on the
# dispatch path cannot work: it would have to decide, per resolve, whether an
# unscoped bead belongs to THIS home, and the label records no home. The only
# home-local ownership record - state/<task_id>.meta's beads_id= - does not exist
# yet at either point a bead is minted (fm-brief.sh mints at scaffold time and
# fm-spawn.sh resolves before it writes the meta), and fm-backlog-import-beads.sh
# writes no metas at all, so a meta-gated read is unreachable for exactly the
# in-flight beads it would exist to rescue, while an ungated one re-adopts other
# homes' beads and reinstates the cross-home bug. Moving the migration out of
# resolve settles both: the dispatch path is a single scoped-label lookup with no
# migration write, and the rescue happens once, deliberately, with the whole
# home-local record set available as evidence.
#
# WHAT IT DOES. For every unscoped task:<id> label in the store whose id this
# home holds a durable record for (fm_beads_home_task_ids), it re-tags the OPEN
# bead carrying that label onto this home's scoped label, and only then.
# fm_beads_home_claims_bead is the claim test: this home's own meta must name
# that exact bead, or this home must hold the task's brief with no meta naming
# any bead. It skips a bead this home's own record contradicts (the meta names a
# different bead), a bead no such record claims, a bead some other home has
# already scoped for that id (fm_beads_bead_has_foreign_scope), and a bead whose
# labels cannot be read at all. Closed beads are excluded by the store's own
# default filter, so a finished task's surviving label is never touched. No label
# is ever removed and no bead is ever closed, and the only bead this sweep writes
# to is one this home can show is its own.
#
# LOSING THE RACE IS NOT ENOUGH. A bead another home has already scoped is left
# alone, but leaving it there is only safe for a task this home has not yet
# dispatched, which simply mints its own bead on its next resolve. An
# ALREADY-DISPATCHED task is pinned to that shared bead by its own
# state/<id>.meta beads_id=, which bin/fm-crew-state.sh and bin/fm-teardown.sh
# read directly and never re-resolve, so it would keep acting on the other home's
# bead forever. For exactly that case the sweep gives this home a bead of its own
# (resolving this home's scoped label first, so a retry after a partial pass
# reuses the bead it already minted) and repoints this home's OWN meta at it
# through fm_beads_home_repoint_recorded_bead. The other home's bead is untouched.
#
# A LOOKUP THAT FAILED IS NOT A LOOKUP THAT FOUND NOTHING. The per-candidate
# `task list` is checked for both its exit status and an array-shaped payload,
# because collapsing a store failure into an empty result would take the benign
# "the surviving label belongs to a closed record" path, write the permanent
# one-shot marker, and leave that bead unmigrated forever.
#
# RESIDUAL AMBIGUITY, stated rather than hidden: when two homes both hold a
# claiming record for one slug and only one pre-migration bead exists, the label
# cannot say which home minted it, so the first home to sweep keeps that bead and
# the second ends up on a bead of its own - minted on its next resolve if it never
# dispatched the task, or minted and repointed by its own sweep if it did. What
# genuinely remains is that the surviving bead's history stays with the winning
# home while the losing home's replacement starts empty, and that the separation
# happens only when the losing home actually runs its sweep, so a home that never
# starts a session, or whose sweep keeps failing against an unreachable store,
# stays pinned to the shared bead until it does.
#
# IDEMPOTENCE. A durable marker records a completed sweep, so later sessions cost
# nothing; the marker is written only when no candidate failed, so a transient
# store failure retries next session. The sweep is also intrinsically idempotent:
# a bead already carrying this home's scoped label is skipped on its own evidence
# even with the marker removed.
#
# SERIALIZATION. The sweep body runs under its own non-blocking lock, the same
# way fm_beads_write_queue_reconcile guards its replay, so two processes in one
# home can never sweep the same store at once. Bootstrap's phase gating already
# keeps the local and network-only passes apart; the lock is what makes that
# safe rather than merely arranged, and it holds if the gating is ever changed.
# A held lock means another process is already doing this one-shot work, so the
# caller returns success silently rather than waiting inside a budgeted phase.
# The whole sweep runs under one budget, and every store call within it under
# whatever of that budget is left, capped at the same per-read bound the
# heartbeat status read uses. A Dolt sql-server that accepts the connection and
# then never answers would otherwise hold the bootstrap phase this sweep runs in
# open on a probe nobody bounded, and a home with many candidates could hold it
# open on their sum even when each call answers. Exhausting the budget leaves the
# marker unwritten, so the sweep resumes next session instead of declaring a
# partial pass complete.

# fm_beads_lookup <task_id> - echo the id of the OPEN bead this home resolves
# <task_id> to, or print nothing and fail. Read-only: it never mints and

# home's scoped task:<home-scope>:<task_id> label - so the common dispatch path
# (every brief scaffold and every spawn, permanently) is one store call with no
# migration write. Pre-migration beads carrying the old unscoped label are
# rescued by fm_beads_migrate_legacy_task_labels instead, not here.
# The default store filter excludes closed beads server side, so a closed
# predecessor is never adopted. This is the single lookup both
# fm_beads_resolve_or_create and fm-backlog-import-beads.sh's
# resolve_existing_bead share, so the importer's "(exists)" annotation and
# blocked-by edges always name the same bead the apply path resolves to.
#
# The optional bound carries the same contract as fm_beads_bead_labels': the
# dispatch path passes none and reads unbounded as it always has, while a caller
# running inside a time budget (the migration sweep) passes what is left of it
# and gets a bounded read or a refusal rather than an unbounded one.
#
# EXIT STATUS, which every caller must distinguish. 0 echoes the bead id. 1 means
# the store answered and no open bead carries this home's label. 2 means the
# question could not be asked or its answer could not be read at all: a missing
# tool, an underivable scope, a failed or bounded-out call, or a payload that is
# not a JSON array. Collapsing 2 into 1 is what lets a transient read failure
# read as "this home has no bead yet" and mint a second bead beside one that
# already exists, so a caller that mints must treat 2 as a refusal rather than a

# fm_beads_resolve_or_create <task_id> [title] - beads-authority migration
# Stage 3 (see data/beads-authority-migration-scout/report.md section "Stage
# 3"): under config/backlog-backend=beads, every firstmate task must have a
# linked bead without requiring an explicit --beads flag. Resolves an existing
# OPEN bead via fm_beads_lookup (the home-scoped task:<scope>:<task_id> label) so
# fm-brief.sh and fm-spawn.sh converge on the same bead regardless of call order,
# and mints one with that scoped label plus the fleet label
# (fm_beads_fleet_label) only if none is found. Echoes the resolved bead id on
# success. It never writes to the store on the resolve path, because it runs at
# every brief scaffold and every spawn.
# Fails open like the rest of the beads integration: prints nothing and
# returns 1 on any missing tool or failure, never blocking dispatch.
#
# A CLOSED bead is never adopted. Task ids are reusable slugs, and
# fm-teardown.sh closes a task's bead without stripping its label, so that
# record outlives the task in the federated store forever. Adopting it would
# link brand-new work to a bead that was already closed before the task
# existed - and a closed bead is the authoritative "task complete" signal
# bin/fm-crew-state.sh reads under this backend, so the fresh crew would
# reconcile as done before its worker made a single commit. Omitting --all
# leaves the store's own default filter in place, so closed predecessors are
# excluded server side and no client-side ordering or page depth can decide

# fm_beads_status <bead-id> - the single owner of reading one bead's status.
# `task show <id> --json` returns a JSON ARRAY ([{...}]), so the status lives at
# .[0].status; every other bin/ reader of a single bead unwraps it the same way
# (fm-decision-hold.sh, fm-backlog-import-beads.sh). Prints the status token to
# stdout, or nothing when the bead is absent, unreadable, or the tools are
# missing. The read is bounded by FM_BEADS_STATUS_TIMEOUT so a wedged Dolt store
# can never stall a caller on the fleet-snapshot/heartbeat path - the same
# bounded-read discipline as FM_CREW_STATE_NM_TIMEOUT / FM_SNAPSHOT_BEADS_TIMEOUT.
#
# The EXIT STATUS distinguishes the three outcomes a caller must not conflate,
# because "the bead is gone" and "the read never completed" are opposite evidence:
#   0                            the read completed; stdout is the status token
#                                (empty when the record carries none)
#   FM_BEADS_STATUS_RC_ABSENT    the read completed and the bead is not there
#   FM_BEADS_STATUS_RC_UNREADABLE  no answer: timeout, missing tool, missing
#                                bound, unparseable output, or a store that could
#                                not be reached to confirm the bead is gone
#
# `task show` exits non-zero for a missing bead AND for a store that is down,
# locked, or unauthenticated, so a failed read alone cannot distinguish them. Only
# a reachable store turns a failed read into ABSENT: fm_beads_store_reachable
# re-probes with the same `task list --limit 1` liveness predicate the write-queue
# reconcile uses, and an unreachable store keeps the outcome UNREADABLE. The probe
# is paid only on the failure path, never on a successful read.
# Stdout still fails open in every non-zero case (nothing printed), so a caller
# that only reads stdout sees "not closed" / "no evidence" rather than a
# completion; a caller deciding whether a write is already applied must check the
# status too.
#
# The bound comes from fm-timeout-lib.sh, sourced only when it is co-located:
# this library is copied on its own into partially-synced remote code roots
# (bin/fm-remote-doctor.sh, bin/fm-backlog-receive.sh both run there under
# `set -eu`), and an unguarded source would abort those scripts at load time
# instead of letting them reach the report that names what is missing. Without
# the bound, fm_beads_status refuses the read rather than running it unbounded.
