  Agent-only handling playbook for session-start bootstrap diagnostics.
  Use whenever the session-start digest's bootstrap section prints an actionable diagnostic line - MISSING, DEGRADED, MISSING_MANUAL, BACKEND_INVALID, NEEDS_GH_AUTH, TANGLE, STARTUP_MEMORY_BUDGET, CREW_DISPATCH invalid, FLEET_SYNC, PR_CHECK_MIGRATION, SECONDMATE_SYNC, SECONDMATE_LIVENESS, NUDGE_SECONDMATES, BEADS_WRITE_QUEUE, or FMX - or when a standalone bin/fm-bootstrap.sh run prints one of those lines.
  A silent bootstrap section, or a BOOTSTRAP_INFO fact, means no skill load.

# bootstrap-diagnostics

Handle each printed line as below, before dispatching work that depends on it.
The line formats themselves are owned by `bin/fm-bootstrap.sh`'s header; this playbook owns the response to actionable lines.
The inline rules in `AGENTS.md` section 3 still bind: detect, then consent, then install - never install anything the captain has not approved in this session - and no work is dispatched until the tools it needs are present and GitHub auth is good.
When any diagnostic needs captain attention, report the plain consequence and requested action using `AGENTS.md` section 9's captain-facing translation contract; do not name the diagnostic label unless the captain needs to paste it into a command or issue.

- `MISSING: <tool> (install: <command>)` - list the missing tools to the captain with a one-line purpose each plus the printed install commands, wait for consent (one approval may cover the list), then run `bin/fm-bootstrap.sh install <approved tools...>`.
  For `treehouse`, this also covers an installed version whose `treehouse get` lacks `--lease`; treat it as an upgrade request.
  For `no-mistakes`, this also covers an installed version older than 1.31.2, because crewmate validation briefs delegate gate mechanics to no-mistakes' version-matched guidance.
  For `tasks-axi`, this also covers an installed build that fails the compatibility probe (`docs/configuration.md` "Backlog backend" owns the definition); `config/backlog-backend=manual` or `config/backlog-backend=beads` only suppresses the verbose `BOOTSTRAP_INFO: tasks-axi available` fact, not this missing-tool report.
  For `task` (the beads CLI), this reports the missing tool only when `config/backlog-backend=beads` is set.
  For `quota-axi`, bootstrap requires it because firstmate reads its current output directly before resolving every crew-dispatch profile array; without it, report the missing requirement and do not choose around an unexamined candidate.
  For the beads task store (`config/backlog-backend=beads`), a missing `task` CLI or an unreachable/broken store only reaches `MISSING:` when no fresh local mirror exists (see `DEGRADED:` below); do not offer the install command as the only option without checking whether the mirror already covers it.
- `DEGRADED: task CLI not found (beads store; install: <command>); using local mirror from <ts> until it is` / `DEGRADED: task store is unreachable or broken (beads backend configured, cannot run 'task list'); using local mirror from <ts> until it is` - the beads task store (`config/backlog-backend=beads`) is down, but a local mirror fresh enough to use exists (`docs/configuration.md` owns the mirror age threshold and files).
  Do not block dispatch on this alone: relay it as a plain-English notice that fleet status is running on a recent cached snapshot rather than live data, and any beads write attempted meanwhile is queued for automatic replay once the store recovers, not lost.
  Investigate the underlying store outage if it persists across multiple bootstraps rather than treating a one-off as actionable.
  This escalates to `MISSING:` only once the mirror itself goes stale (or never existed), at which point handle it exactly like an ordinary `MISSING:` install/instructions gap.
- `MISSING_MANUAL: <tool> (instructions: <url>)` - tell the captain why the tool is required and give them the printed instructions URL, but do not pass the tool to `bin/fm-bootstrap.sh install`; wait for the captain to complete the manual installation, then rerun session start to confirm the dependency is present.
- `BACKEND_INVALID: <name> (known: <names>)` - the resolved runtime backend has no verified dependency or lifecycle contract, so do not dispatch work until the invalid `FM_BACKEND` or `config/backend` value is corrected to one of the listed backends.
- `NEEDS_GH_AUTH` - ask the captain to run `! gh auth login` (interactive; you cannot run it for them).
- `TANGLE: <remediation>` - the primary checkout is stranded on a feature branch instead of its default branch; `AGENTS.md` section 8 explains why this guard exists and what it protects.
  The work is safe on that branch ref; restore the primary to its default branch with the printed `git -C <root> checkout <default>`, then re-validate that branch in a proper worktree.
  This is the only sanctioned firstmate-initiated git write to the primary, and it is a non-destructive branch switch that strands nothing.
- `STARTUP_MEMORY_BUDGET: invalid config/startup-memory-budget - <reason>` - the visible startup-memory budget is not a safe one-line positive decimal file; do not infer the default or propagate it. Correct the local primary file, then rerun session start so the normal convergence path can deliver the validated value to secondmate homes.
- `CREW_DISPATCH: invalid config/crew-dispatch.json - <reason>` - the optional dispatch profile file exists but failed low-cost bootstrap validation; stop profile-based dispatch, report the actionable error, and require correction of the malformed schema, unverified harness name, or invalid harness/effort pair rather than falling back around it or selecting a bad profile.
- `FLEET_SYNC: <repo>: skipped: <reason>` - a benign one-off skip (offline, no origin, local-only); bootstrap continued, investigate only if it blocks work.
  A skip can also report the bounded fleet-refresh timeout (`FM_FLEET_SYNC_BOOTSTRAP_TIMEOUT`, or a fleet-size-aware default with a 20 second floor); a timeout never blocks startup.
- `FLEET_SYNC: <repo>: recovered: <detail>` - the clone had drifted onto a clean detached HEAD holding no unique commits and the sync self-healed it (re-attached the default branch and fast-forwarded); no action needed, it is reported only so the self-heal is visible.
- `FLEET_SYNC: <repo>: STUCK: on <state>, N commits behind <base> - needs attention` - the clone is dirty, on a non-default branch, detached with unique commits, or diverged, so the sync left it untouched (never forcing or discarding); it will keep falling behind until you look.
  A loud STUCK, especially a growing N across bootstraps, means that clone needs hands-on attention; dispatch a crewmate or resolve it before it strands work.
- `PR_CHECK_MIGRATION: canonical polls rebuilt and armed; resume supervision for this home` - the non-executing migration rebuilt canonical task polls from validated metadata, and those polls are already armed.
  Independently verify the private per-task outcome record, then resume the emitted supervision protocol after finishing the session-start wake handling.
- `PR_CHECK_MIGRATION: validated replacement polls armed; resume supervision for this home` - a retry proved canonical publication provenance, metadata identity binding, and single-link integrity for a replacement poll resolving an earlier ambiguous migration outcome.
  Independently verify the private per-task outcome record, then resume the emitted supervision protocol after finishing the session-start wake handling.
- `PR_CHECK_MIGRATION: quarantined polls remain unarmed; review state/.pr-check-migration.log before rearming` - one or more ambiguous or invalid task polls were quarantined without execution and remain unarmed.
  Read the private mode-`0600` per-task outcome record, verify the task's recorded PR independently, and rearm only through `bin/fm-pr-check.sh` with canonical inputs.
- `PR_CHECK_MIGRATION: migration completed safely; resume supervision for this home` - migration crossed the update boundary without rebuilding or quarantining a task poll after pausing the prior watcher.
  Resume the emitted supervision protocol after finishing the session-start wake handling.
- Any other `PR_CHECK_MIGRATION:` refusal means migration did not complete safely, whether because watcher exclusion, a private path, a diagnostic, quarantine validation, or marker publication could not be proved.
  Keep each affected poll unavailable, inspect the named private state path, and do not bypass the migration or execute a quarantined artifact; a completed safe-scan marker allows unrelated authenticated polls to continue while private repair remains pending.
- `SECONDMATE_SYNC: secondmate <id>: skipped: <reason>` - the local-HEAD secondmate sync left a live secondmate home on its existing checkout because the home was dirty, diverged, unsafe, on the wrong branch, missing the primary target commit, or otherwise not fast-forwardable, or because inherited local-material propagation failed; bootstrap continued, but inspect the reason because the secondmate's tracked instructions, inherited settings, or shared captain preferences may be stale after a primary update.
- `SECONDMATE_LIVENESS: secondmate <id>: skipped: <reason>|respawn failed after <cause>: <reason>` - the session-start liveness sweep could not guarantee that the registered secondmate is running a real agent process.
  Investigate the reason because that secondmate is not guaranteed live.
- `NUDGE_SECONDMATES: secondmate <id>: send failed: <reason>` - the secondmate sweep fast-forwarded a running secondmate home and its loaded instruction surface (`AGENTS.md`, `bin/`, or `.agents/skills/`) changed, but the deterministic `fm-send.sh fm-<id>` re-read nudge failed.
  Inspect the reason, keep the pending marker under `state/.secondmate-nudge-pending/` intact, and rerun session start after the endpoint or metadata issue is fixed so bootstrap can retry the exact same marked send.
- `FMX: X mode on ...` / `FMX: X mode off ...` - bootstrap confirmed or removed the local X-mode poll artifacts (`docs/configuration.md` "X mode (.env)").
  Only when a running watcher needs the cadence transition applied immediately, restart the home-scoped watcher through the emitted harness supervision protocol; bootstrap deliberately never restarts the watcher itself.
- `BEADS_WRITE_QUEUE: reconciled queued write for <id> (<description>)` - a beads write that failed during an earlier outage (dispatch stamp, assignment, or a task-close) replayed cleanly against the recovered store on this bootstrap's mutating sweep; no action needed, it is reported only so the recovery is visible.
  `(bead already closed)` on a queued close means the bead was already closed - by the outage's original close attempt landing after all, or by someone else - and firstmate reconciled instead of retrying it forever.
- `BEADS_WRITE_QUEUE: task CLI not found, N write(s) remain queued` / `BEADS_WRITE_QUEUE: store still unreachable, N write(s) remain queued` - the beads store outage is still ongoing; treat the same as an unresolved `DEGRADED:`/`MISSING:` beads line above rather than a new problem, and expect the queue to keep draining on later bootstraps once the store recovers.
- `BEADS_WRITE_QUEUE: replay failed for <id> (<description>); re-queued` - a queued write hit a genuine replay failure (not just an unreachable store) and was left queued for the next attempt.
  Investigate if the same id keeps failing to replay across multiple bootstraps rather than treating a one-off as actionable.
