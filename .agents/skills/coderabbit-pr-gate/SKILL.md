# CodeRabbit review-gate routine

This skill applies to every public registered repo with CodeRabbit enabled.
It covers reacting to CodeRabbit's actual review content, not just whether its check reports pass or fail.
The watcher's PR poll already wakes firstmate on a new bot review comment (see `state/<id>.pr-review-seen` in `AGENTS.md` section 2); this skill is the reaction policy layered on top of that wake, not a second wake mechanism.

## Policy

A green CodeRabbit check is necessary but not sufficient.
CodeRabbit can pass a PR while still leaving actionable suggestion comments (bugs, security notes, missed edge cases) that a bare status check does not surface.
Before treating a PR as merge-ready on a CodeRabbit-enabled repo:

1. Read CodeRabbit's review comments on the PR (via `gh-axi`), not just its check conclusion.
2. Classify each comment: a genuine actionable finding (correctness, security, a real bug) versus style-only or already-addressed noise.
3. Route actionable findings the same way any other review finding is routed under `AGENTS.md` section 7 and `ask-user-authority`.
   A routine, reversible fix within accepted task criteria is autonomous under `yolo`; anything that would expand scope, or is destructive, irreversible, or security-sensitive, escalates to the captain as a decision rather than being silently applied or silently ignored.
4. Do not merge past an unresolved actionable CodeRabbit finding without either fixing it or getting an explicit captain or `yolo`-authorized decision to proceed anyway.

## Rate-limit handling

CodeRabbit rate-limits review requests on busy repos or accounts.
A rate-limited or not-yet-reviewed state is not a failure and not silence to route around:

- Treat a CodeRabbit rate-limit or pending-review response as a `paused:`-class external wait (`AGENTS.md` section 8's distinction between `paused:` and `blocked:`), not a `blocked:` or `failed:` one.
- Re-check on a bounded backoff rather than polling tightly or repeatedly re-requesting a review, which extends the rate limit; let the watcher's own wake cadence carry the recheck instead of arming a dedicated poll loop for it.
- If CodeRabbit still has not produced a review after a reasonable number of backoff cycles, do not block merge readiness on it indefinitely.
  Report the stalled review to the captain as evidence rather than silently merging without it or silently waiting forever.
- Never spam re-requests at CodeRabbit to work around a rate limit; that worsens the limit for every repo sharing the account.

## Scope

Applies to every public registered repo, including non-owned repos dispatched to via a fork (see `AGENTS.md` section 7 and `night-ops-directive`).
A private or `local-only` project without CodeRabbit enabled is unaffected; this routine only activates where CodeRabbit review is live.
