# The rules above are exercised through explicit paths so they stay readable.
# This fixture proves the rest: that the selector derives the changed set from
# a git range at all, and that the transitive reverse source-chain closure
# selects a test naming only the consumer of a changed library.
#
# The inert-path and unmapped-path rules can ONLY be proven here. Selection is
# a fixed-string scan of the test corpus, so naming a path in a test file
# against the real repo makes that test reference it, and the case under test
# stops being the case that runs. A repo whose whole corpus is written here has
# no such coupling.
