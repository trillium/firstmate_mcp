# Drives the guard through its CLI against an ISOLATED fixture tree (its own
# root, register, snapshot dir, and a fake target script) via the FM_PROV_ROOT /
# FM_PROV_REGISTER / FM_PROV_SNAP_DIR overrides, so nothing here touches the real
# bin/ scripts or the real register. Asserts the guard's contract through exit
# codes and messages, never by reading implementation source bytes:
#   - green (exit 0) on an intact tree,
#   - red (exit 1) when an anchored symbol is deleted (deletion tripwire),
#   - red (exit 1) when a feature's behavior changes vs its approved snapshot,
#   - and that a mere signature drift is a WARN, not a FAIL.
