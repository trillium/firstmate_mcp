# add_beads_task_mock_store <fakebin_dir> <calls_log> <store_json> <minted_id>
# [emit_labels]: a fake `task` CLI backed by a small on-disk store. `list`
# applies the same --label (AND), --status, --all, and --limit semantics the real
# CLI documents - including truncating to --limit AFTER filtering - so a lookup
# that forgets a filter sees exactly the rows it meant to exclude instead of a
# fixture that answers correctly no matter what was asked. Rows are
# {id,status,labels}; `create` reports <minted_id>.
#
# The store is a FILE, and `tag` writes to it, so a migration and the resolve
# that follows it see one store evolving rather than two disconnected fixtures -
# which is what lets a test assert that a re-tagged bead is afterwards found by
# its scoped label.
#
# The real CLI does NOT return a labels field from `list --json` (it is served
# separately by `label list <id> --json`, a flat array of label strings), so the
# mock strips labels from its list rows by default and serves `label list` and
# `label list-all` too, and a reader of a bead's labels exercises the same
# two-call shape it does in production. Pass <emit_labels> as "true" for the
# forward-compatible case where the payload already carries labels.

# fm_path_without jq excision above took date with it, `$(date +%s)` expanded to
# nothing, and `$(( + FM_BEADS_SYNC_BUDGET ))` collapsed to the budget alone - a
# 1970 deadline that made every bounded step report the budget as already spent.
# On a host where date sits in its own directory the excision leaves it in
# place, which is exactly why this passed locally and failed only in CI.

# that holds date would take jq and the rest of coreutils with it on Linux and
# prove nothing about the clock.

# read is either transparently survived (EPOCHSECONDS needs no PATH at all) or
