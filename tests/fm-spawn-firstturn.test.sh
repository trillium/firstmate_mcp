# it. Under load that typed line can be lost, leaving an agent parked at an
# empty composer while the spawn reports success.
#
# These drive the real fm-spawn.sh against a fake tmux that decides, per case,
# whether the harness's turn-lifecycle hook fires - the exact variable the
# incident turned on. bin/fm-firstturn-lib.sh's verdict logic is covered
# separately by tests/fm-firstturn.test.sh; what is pinned here is what a spawn
# DOES with each verdict: detect, resubmit exactly once, log distinguishably,
# and never resubmit into an agent that already started.
