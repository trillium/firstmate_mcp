# Behavior tests for bin/fm-pool-reclaim.sh - the treehouse pool reclaimer.
#
# A treehouse pool only shrinks: `treehouse prune` skips any worktree with
# uncommitted changes, and a lease is durable until an explicit return, so every
# endpoint that dies without reaching fm-teardown.sh leaks its slot forever.
# fm-pool-reclaim reclaims the two leak shapes that need no judgment and must
# refuse everything else, because its return is `--force` (which resets) and a
# wrong verdict destroys unlanded work.
#
# Each case runs over real throwaway git repos - the dirt classification reads
# real `git status --porcelain` output, so a fake would only confirm the
# assumption written into the fake - with a fake `treehouse` that serves a canned
# `status --json` pool and records every `return` invocation to a log:
#   (a) spent slot: only a deleted hook dropping is dirty        -> reclaimed
#   (b) real untracked work alongside the dropping               -> skipped
#   (c) real MODIFIED file that is not a dropping                -> skipped
#   (d) stale lease, no processes, past the threshold            -> reclaimed
#       and returned with --if-lease-id so a re-lease is refused
#   (e) fresh lease inside the threshold                         -> skipped
#   (f) lease with no parseable timestamp                        -> skipped
#   (g) any live process in the worktree                         -> untouched
#   (h) dry run is the default: it decides but returns nothing
#   (i) --only-if-exhausted no-ops while a slot is available, and sweeps when
#       every slot is spoken for
#   (j) fail-open: a missing treehouse, a failing status, and unparseable JSON
#       all exit 0 so the spawn pre-flight can never be why a spawn fails
#   (k) empty-field alignment: an unleased dirty worktree's two empty lease
#       fields must not shift the process count or age left (the tab-vs-US
#       separator regression - tab is IFS whitespace and collapses runs)
#   (l) every RFC3339Nano fraction width Go emits ages correctly, including the
#       widths fromisoformat rejects outright before Python 3.11
#   (m) a dirty slot claimed by someone else mid-sweep is re-verified and left
#       alone, since an unleased slot has no lease id to guard the return with
