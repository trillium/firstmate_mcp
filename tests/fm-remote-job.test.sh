# Inert unless the trip file exists, so every other subtest sees the real clock.
# While it exists, clock reads taken after a job is both armed and wired for
# output capture fail. The trip file's contents select which ones, in the two
# shapes the guards need proving against:
#
#   empty  - fail the first such read, then disarm, so every later read is real.
#   count N - let N through, then fail that read and every read after it.
#
# The reads are enumerable rather than timing-dependent, because
# worker_run_with_timeout takes exactly two kinds while a job is armed - one
# sizing the cheap poll gate, then one per poll deciding the kill once that gate
# opens. So an empty trip file fails the gate sizing, a count of 1 leaves the
# gate correctly sized and fails every kill decision, and a count of 0 lets no
# read through at all, so the gate sizing and every kill decision after it fail
# together. The last two are what force the kill onto the forkless SECONDS
# fallback rather than a later real read. Reads that mint the deadline come
# before the job is armed.
#
# The sticky form cannot signal that it fired by removing the trip file, so it
# overwrites it with `tripped` instead and the subtest asserts that, keeping the
# same non-vacuity guarantee as the one-shot form.
